Live-SWE-agent is the **first *live*, runtime self-evolving software engineering agent** that expands and revises its own capabilities *on the fly* while working on a real-world issue. 
Our key insight is that **software agents are themselves software systems**, and modern LLM-based agents already possess the intrinsic capability to extend or modify their own behavior at runtime. 

## 📣 News

- **[Nov 24th, 2025]**: Claude Opus 4.5 + Live-SWE-agent scores 79.2% on SWE-bench Verified, leading all current open-source scaffolds and coming very close to Anthropic’s internal, manually engineered scaffold for Opus 4.5!!
- **[Nov 20th, 2025]**: Gemini 3 Pro + Live-SWE-agent scores 77.4% on SWE-bench Verified, outperforming all available models (including Claude 4.5)!
- **[Nov 17th, 2025]**: Live-SWE-agent achieves the new state-of-the-art solve rate of 45.8% on SWE-Bench Pro!
- **[Nov 17th, 2025]**: We've released Live-SWE-agent 1.0.0!

## 🏆 Leaderboard

For software tasks, recent LLMs are often benchmarked using manually engineered, proprietary agent scaffolds, which makes it difficult to compare the true capabilities of different models fairly.

Live-SWE-agent not only demonstrates that a minimal, open, and live scaffold already has the ability to outperform proprietary scaffolds, but also offers a unified and powerful platform that enables genuinely fair, apples-to-apples comparisons for future model releases.

As shown below, on our leaderboard of recent models (all evaluated with Live-SWE-agent), **Claude Opus 4.5** retains the #1 spot with a score of 79.2% on SWE-bench Verified by a large margin.

More model scores are coming soon! For more details, please visit our [leaderboard](https://live-swe-agent.github.io/). Feel free to submit your model's evaluation results to help build a more comprehensive and fair benchmarking platform!

## 📊 Comparison

Below shows the comparison graph between Live-SWE-agent and state-of-the-art open-source solutions and proprietary commercial agent scaffolds on SWE-bench Verified and SWE-Bench Pro.

## 🚀 Setup

We built Live-SWE-agent on top of the popular [mini-swe-agent](https://github.com/SWE-agent/mini-swe-agent) framework with very minimal modifications.

To use Live-SWE-agent, simply install mini-swe-agent first using this [guide]() and use the custom Live-SWE-agent config:

```shell
mini --config config/livesweagent.yaml # using custom Live-SWE-agent config
```

See the `config` folder for more details.

## ⚙️ Artifacts

You can download the complete trajectories, patches, and results of Live-SWE-agent in our [v1.0.0 release](https://github.com/OpenAutoCoder/live-swe-agent/releases/tag/v1.0.0):
- `swebench_verified`: complete runs on SWE-bench Verified
- `swebench_pro`: complete runs on SWE-Bench Pro

You also obtain them in our 🤗 huggingface [datasets](https://huggingface.co/livesweagent/datasets)
